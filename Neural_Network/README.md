# Neural Network

I wanted to create a neural network from scratch based on what I have learnt over the course of my masters along with Andrew Ng Deep Learning course

- Neural Network Single Layer is the first attempt in which I used just a single hidden layer and defined the required functions
- NN_Class was completed after this and what this achieves is a neural network class which allows the user to define how many hidden layers they want and the number of neuron per hidden layer.

The activation function is Tanh for both networks along with SoftMax for the final output neuron.

This is a simple implementation that does not use drop out, different optimisation strategies such as Adam, neither does it allow the user to do a regression task. 

Hope you enjoy this as much as I did creating it.
